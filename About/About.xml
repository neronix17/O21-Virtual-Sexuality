	<description>Lightweight sexuality overhaul for RimWorld.
- Sexuality is a new section of the Bio using a new separate system instead of traits.
- Vanilla has men wanting younger women, and women wanting older men, pawns will now just be more likely to go for someone their own age.
- Pawns should now be much less likely to flirt with those who are never going to be interested.
