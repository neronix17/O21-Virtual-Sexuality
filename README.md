# O21-Virtual-Sexuality
RimWorld mod stripping out sexual orientation traits and making them a separate system entirely. While making attraction age appropriate on top of that.

Sexuality is now a separate system in the Bio tab, no longer taking up a trait slot just to be 'not straight'.
Sexualities:
- Heterosexual - (Straight) attracted to the opposite sex.
- Homosexual - (Gay/Lesbian) attracted to the same sex.
- Bisexual - (Bi) attracted to both Male and Female sexes.
- Pansexual - (Pan) attracted to anyone regardless of sex.
- Asexual - (Ace) not attracted to anyone.

This is just how they apply in-game, reading any further is on you not me.

=== Frequently Asked Questions ===

Q: Why bother with Pansexual?
A: Why bother with Bisexual? Both have their own separate purpose for RimWorld. Just because you're too short sighted to see there's HAR races with no gender doesn't mean I am.

Q: [angry bigot noises] But there's no gender in RimWorld!
A: Not a question, but there is actually. The specific wording used in the games code is gender, which there are Male, Female and None. These are not tied to body type, meaning you can have a Male pawn with the Female body very easily if assigned that way in backstory, and the other way around. The system there means it is very much possible to have transgender pawns, Ludeon just didn't make any. I know you probably can't hear me at this point with the blood in your ears already boiling but it's fine, your opinion doesn't matter.

Q: Soo...for those of us who read that and weren't enraged?
A: No this doesn't currently have gender identity as a thing. But it is something I will be adding in future.

Q: Why isn't this on Steam?
A: See the second question. Steam Workshop is filled with very small minded people, and any sexuality mod that doesn't allow them to flat out exclude anything they don't like is bombarded with negative ratings. That's not even exclusive to straight CIS folks either. I won't be uploading it there and I'm not going to allow anyone else to do it on my behalf either.
